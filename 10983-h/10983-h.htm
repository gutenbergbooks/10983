    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a picture of a fine large English ship, called the
      <em>Charles Eaton</em>, which was wrecked in the Southern
      Ocean. The crew, you see, have made a raft of some of the
      spars and planks of the ship, and having all got upon it, are
      about cutting loose from the wreck, with the hope that they
      may reach one of the distant islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor men! they did indeed reach the island; but only to meet
      a more dreadful death than that threatened them by the waves.
      Overcome with fatigue and anxiety, they no sooner gained the
      shore, than they all, captain, crew, and passengers, threw
      themselves on the earth, and soon were fast asleep. In this
      helpless state, they were attacked by the cruel and
      blood-thirsty savages who inhabited the island, and all
      barbarously murdered, except two little boys, John and
      William Doyley.
    </p>
    <p>
      These children, sons of a gentleman and lady who had been
      passengers in the ill-fated ship, were kept in captivity by
      the savages for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of the shipwreck, John was a stout lad, thirteen
      or fourteen years old; but little William was a mere infant,
      being scarcely two years of age! Think what a dreadful life
      these poor little orphans had before them! Their kind parents
      cruelly murdered, and themselves prisoners to the barbarous
      murderers!
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the savages treated them harshly, and made them
      endure all kinds of privation and hardship. Finally, after
      changing from one cruel master to another several times, they
      were purchased by one more humane than the rest, named
      Dupper, who took them to his home on a distant island, and
      treated them with a great deal of kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="leftaligned" src="p3-teach.png" alt=
      "Drawing of a lesson in using bow and arrow." width="350"
      height="409">
    </p>
    <p>
      Dupper taught John how to shoot with the bow and arrow, with
      which he was himself very expert. He also showed him their
      method of spearing fish, and taught him many other savage
      accomplishments. In Dupper's family, too, the boys both
      learned to speak the native language, and they soon almost
      forgot their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they did not forget their own country; at least John did
      not; and as he often talked with William about their dear
      parents, and the pleasant home they had left many miles away,
      there was but little danger of William forgetting it either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though kindly treated by Dupper and his family, and made as
      comfortable as their savage mode of life would allow, yet
      they suffered many cruel hardships, and severely felt the
      change from their former to their present way of living. They
      constantly sighed for home, and were made quite wretched by
      the prospect of a captivity to which they could see no end,
      except in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the same kind Providence who had preserved them when
      their parents and the crew of the unfortunate ship were
      murdered, still watched over and protected these despairing
      orphans. The day of their deliverance came quite
      unexpectedly. An English vessel arrived at the island, and
      cast her anchor near the shore. The natives immediately
      manned their canoes, and flocked on board, to trade with the
      strangers. John was permitted to go with the others, and when
      on the deck of the vessel, he told the captain and officers
      all about the shipwreck, the murder of the crew and
      passengers, and his own and his brother's captivity.
    </p>
    <p>

      "Drawing of the two boys saying farewell to Dupper."
         width="350" height="431">
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind captain listened to his story, and then set at once
      about effecting the release of the two boys, which he easily
      accomplished, and William soon joined John on board of the
      vessel, where Dupper also appeared, to take leave of his
      young friends. The kind native was quite sad at the parting,
      and shed tears of regret as he bade them farewell. But the
      boys were too happy in the expectation of seeing home once
      more, to grieve at parting with him, although he had been
      more kind to them than any of his countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning early, the ship set sail, and after visiting
      various places, she finally reached England in safety, where
      our two orphans were restored to their surviving friends, by
      whom they were kindly taken care of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us hope these little boys were ever grateful to their
      Heavenly Father, who had watched over and preserved them amid
      all their trials and sufferings, and finally enabled them to
      reach their home and friends. And let us all remember, that
      we can trust in Him, for He is able to preserve us, as well
      in the hour of danger as in that of fancied security and
      safety. Our lives are in His hands at all times, and it is
      from His mercy and goodness that we are fed, and clothed, and
      enjoy the many blessings which He constantly bestows upon us.
